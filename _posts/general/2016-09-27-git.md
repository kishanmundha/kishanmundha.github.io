Git is a version control system that is used for software development and other version control tasks. As a distributed revision control system it is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

### Revert changes to modified files.

```
$ git reset --hard
```

### Remove all untracked files and directories.


```
$ git clean -fd
```

> (`-f` is `force`, `-d` is `remove directories`)

### Revert any commited code

``` bash
$ git checkout master
$ git reset --hard e3f1e37
$ git push --force origin master
# Then to prove it (it won't print any diff)
$ git diff master..origin/master
```
